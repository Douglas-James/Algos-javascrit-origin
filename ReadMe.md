## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Arrays

- A collection of elements of the same type, enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`.
- The elements are indexed by their position in the array, starting from zero.
- The size of an array is fixed, once declared.

### Linked Lists

- A collection of elements, where each element points to the next one.
- The elements are not indexed by position, but by reference.
- The size of a linked list can vary at runtime.

### Stacks

- A Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure.
- You can only access the element on the top of the stack.
- You can add or remove elements from the top of the stack.

### Queues

- A First In First Out (FIFO) data structure.
- You can only access the element at the front of the queue.
- You can add elements to the back of the queue, and remove elements from the front.

### Binary Trees

- A root node, and zero or more child nodes, each with their own left and right child nodes.
- The root node is the topmost node in the tree.
- Each child node can have a maximum of two child nodes.

### Hash Tables

- A data structure that stores key-value pairs.
- Keys are used as indices into the hash table, to retrieve the corresponding value.
- Hash tables can be used to implement dictionaries, or to quickly look up a value based on a key.

### Graphs

- A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
- Each node represents a vertex, and each edge represents a connection between two vertices.
- A graph can be directed or undirected.
- In a directed graph, edges have a direction and can only be traversed in that direction.
- In an undirected graph, edges have no direction and can be traversed in both directions.
